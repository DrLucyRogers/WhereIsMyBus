# WhereIsMyBus
Arduino Code, Node-RED flow and STL files for #WhereIsMyBus - alerts when your bus is 3-6 mins away from your bus-stop.
When not in use, it becomes a #Cheerlights light.

Used on Project #WhereIsMyBus
  - 3D Printed Bus
  - WeMOS D1 with 8 neopixels connected on pin 4 
  - Internet connected Raspberry Pi
  - Cheerlights and TFL API's

Contains: 
  - Arduino Code - BusLocalPiv3.ino by Andy Stanford-Clark with contribution from James Macfarlane
  - Node-RED flow - (TBA)
  - STL Files for 3D printing bus - with thanks to Steve Cox (@SteveCox3D) for initial design
